## Implementation Details

The enhancements were implemented using pure Node.js with a focus on:

1. **Standard Libraries**: Minimize third-party dependencies
2. **Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with existing code
3. **Readability**: Keep code clear and well-documented
4. **Maintainability**: Design for future enhancement
5. **Security**: Follow best practices for secure code execution

## Known Limitations

Despite the significant improvements, some limitations remain:

1. **VM Security**: Node's VM module is not designed as a complete security boundary
2. **Nested Templates**: Limited support for nested template expressions
3. **Browser Compatibility**: Server-side enhancements only
4. **Legacy Support**: Some features require newer Node.js versions for optimal performance

## Future Directions

Planned enhancements for future versions:

1. **VM2 Integration**: Replace Node's VM module with the more secure VM2 library
2. **Conditional Templates**: Add support for conditional rendering within templates
3. **Plugin System**: Create an extensible plugin architecture
4. **Integration Testing**: Add comprehensive integration tests
5. **Performance Profiling**: Add detailed performance metrics
