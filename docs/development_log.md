## Development Log Summary: UI Enhancements & Interactive Features

This log details the iterative refinement process for the UI, particularly the Element Histogram and Bracelet interactions, culminating in a personalized and dynamic user experience.

### 1. Element Histogram Evolution

The goal was to clearly visualize the user's current five-element balance (`current`) against the recommended balance (`goal`).

* **Initial Attempts:**
    * Dual-bar overlays were initially implemented but discarded based on feedback regarding visual clarity, especially when target values were lower than current values.
    * A single grey bar with a thin colored target marker was tried but lacked visual appeal and didn't clearly show the *magnitude* of the current value relative to the target.
* **Semi-Transparent Overlay:** An approach using a solid color bar up to `current` and a semi-transparent extension to `goal` (if `goal > current`) was introduced. This better conveyed the "gap" to reach the target. However, it failed to clearly indicate the target when `goal < current`.
* **Final Design - Vertical Marker & Floating Badges:**
    * **Visualization:** A single bar per element represents the `current` percentage with full opacity using the element's specific color. If `goal > current`, a semi-transparent overlay of the *same color* extends from `current` to `goal`. Crucially, a distinct **vertical colored line** is always rendered at the exact `goal` percentage, ensuring the target is always visible, regardless of whether it's above or below the `current` value. Zero values render a minimal sliver for visibility.
    * **Labels:** Percentage values for both `current` and `goal` are displayed as styled "badges" (with background/padding) floating *above* the bar, ensuring immediate readability without hovering.
    * **Code Snippet (Conceptual JSX within map):**
        ```jsx
        // Inside ElementHistogram.js map function
        const currPercent = current[key] || 0;
        const goalPercent = goal[key] || 0;
        const color = colors[key] || defaultColor;

        <div style={{ /* container styles */ }}>
          {/* Element Name */}
          <span>{key}</span>
          {/* Bar Area */}
          <div style={{ position: 'relative', height: barHeight, background: '#eee', width: '100%' }}>
            {/* Current Value Bar (Solid) */}
            <div style={{ width: `${currPercent}%`, background: color, height: '100%', position: 'absolute' }} />
            {/* Target Extension Overlay (Semi-Transparent, only if goal > current) */}
            {goalPercent > currPercent && (
              <div style={{ left: `${currPercent}%`, width: `${goalPercent - currPercent}%`, background: color, opacity: 0.4, height: '100%', position: 'absolute' }} />
            )}
            {/* Goal Marker Line (Always Visible) */}
            <div style={{ left: `${goalPercent}%`, width: '2px', background: color, height: '100%', position: 'absolute' }} />
            {/* Floating Badges */}
            <span style={{ /* badge styles, position absolute above bar near current% */ }}>{currPercent.toFixed(1)}%</span>
            <span style={{ /* badge styles, position absolute above bar near goal% */ }}>{goalPercent.toFixed(1)}%</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        ```

### 2. Personalized Color Integration

To enhance personalization, the system was upgraded to use specific colors recommended based on the user's Bazi analysis.

* **DeepSeek Prompt Enhancement:** The prompt sent to the DeepSeek API was modified to explicitly request a *single, resonant hex color* (`#RRGGBB`) for each of the five elements, tailored to the user's specific Bazi chart for optimal energy harmony. This color is requested as a fourth column in the Markdown table output.
    ```text
    // Excerpt from updated DeepSeek Prompt in api/astro.js
    ...
    3. 五行调节比例：使用Markdown表格，包含“推荐颜色”列，其值为上面定制的专属HEX颜色：
    | 五行 | 原局比例 | 调节目标 | 推荐颜色 |
    | ---- | ---- | ---- | -------- |
    | 金   | xx%      | yy%      | #RRGGBB  |
    | ...  | ...      | ...      | ...      |
    ...
    ```
* **OpenAI Parsing:** The JSON schema used with the OpenAI Responses API was updated to expect and extract a `colors` object alongside `current` and `goal`.
    ```json
    // Schema excerpt for OpenAI Responses API
    {
      "properties": {
        "current": { /* percentages */ },
        "goal": { /* percentages */ },
        "colors": { "type": "object", "properties": { "metal": { "type": "string" }, /* etc */ } }
      },
      "required": ["current", "goal", "colors"]
    }
    ```
* **UI Application:**
    * The `ElementHistogram` component now receives and uses the `colors` prop, falling back to defaults if necessary: `const color = colors[key] || ELEMENT_COLORS[key];`.
    * The `SidePalette` component's bead list (`paletteBeads`) prioritizes displaying beads based on the fetched `ratios.colors`.

### 3. Bracelet Randomization & Animation Controls

Interactive features were added to visualize the recommended element distribution on the bracelet.

* **Core Randomization (`generateBeadsList`, `randomizeBracelet`):**
    * Calculates the number of beads required for each element based on `ratios.goal` percentages and the total `numBeads`. Includes logic to handle rounding errors and ensure the total bead count is correct.
    * Uses the personalized `ratios.colors` (or defaults) for each bead.
    * Employs the Fisher-Yates algorithm to shuffle the generated bead list for a random visual arrangement.
    * A "随机排珠" button allows manual re-shuffling.
* **Animation Modes:**
    * **Flash Shuffle ("动画"):** `animateRandomize` rapidly calls `randomizeBracelet` using recursive `setTimeout` for a dynamic shuffling effect (5 times/sec for 5s by default).
    * **Growth Animation ("增长动画"):** `animateGrow` animates the bracelet filling up bead-by-bead, from 1 to the defined `MAX_BEADS` constant (e.g., 20), regenerating the correctly proportioned bead list at each step. Also uses recursive `setTimeout`.
* **Live Speed Control:**
    * A slider allows users to adjust the animation speed multiplier (`speedMultiplier`) between 0.5x and 2.0x.
    * **Dynamic Update:** To ensure speed changes apply *during* an ongoing animation, the `speedMultiplier` state is stored in a `React.useRef` (`speedRef`). The `setTimeout` delay in both animation functions reads `speedRef.current` for each step, guaranteeing that the latest slider value is used immediately without interrupting the animation.
    * **Code Snippet (Live Speed Update Logic):**
        ```javascript
        // In App.js
        const [speedMultiplier, setSpeedMultiplier] = useState(1);
        const speedRef = React.useRef(speedMultiplier);
        React.useEffect(() => { speedRef.current = speedMultiplier; }, [speedMultiplier]);

        // Inside animation functions (e.g., animateRandomize's run function)
        setTimeout(run, 200 / speedRef.current); // Delay uses the *current* ref value

        // Slider JSX
        <input type="range" min="0.5" max="2" step="0.1" value={speedMultiplier} onChange={/* ... */} />
        ```

### 4. UX Enhancements

Minor adjustments were made for better usability:

* **Button Placement:** Animation control buttons were moved to a dedicated row below the `BraceletCanvas` for better visibility and layout consistency across screen sizes.
* **Input Disabling:** The `numBeads` input is disabled during animations to prevent state conflicts. The speed slider remains enabled for live interaction.

### 5. Utility Feature: Copy Report

* A "复制报告" button was added below the analysis results panel.
* It uses the `navigator.clipboard.writeText` API to copy both the raw `analysis` text and the structured `ratios` (current, goal, colors) object as a JSON string to the clipboard, facilitating easy saving or sharing.
